A prototype of the virtual trial room solution proposed by us

Imagine a shopping experience where you can see exactly how a piece of clothing will look on your body before you make a purchase. Our Virtual Try-On (VTO) feature revolutionizes the way customers shop for clothes online by offering a highly interactive and personalized experience.

Scan and Capture: Using the camera on their smartphone, users can take a full-body photo or simply scan their body in real time. Our advanced AI-powered technology captures precise body measurements and creates a 3D model of the user’s body.

Select and Try: Users can browse through our extensive catalogue of clothing and select the items they’re interested in. With a simple tap, the chosen garments are virtually overlaid onto the user’s 3D model, allowing them to see how the clothing fits and drapes on their actual body shape.

Adjust and Customize: The feature allows users to adjust the fit and size of the garments to match their preferences. They can try different sizes, colours, and styles to find the perfect fit. The 3D model updates in real time, providing a realistic view from all angles.

Share and Decide: Users can share their virtual try-on images with friends and family via social media or messaging apps, gathering opinions and making confident purchasing decisions. They can also save their favourite looks for future reference.
